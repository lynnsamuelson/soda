# soda
This page is written as a static html page using Vue.js.  The app mimics a smart soda machine that allows users to add money and pick a soda.  The quantity of each flavor of soda is display on the button.  A history of purchases is displayed below the soda machine user interface.

# Demo
A demo can be found at:

# Installation

Since this is a static page, clone this repo and open the html page in your browser.  The code also indules a node server, that can be used, but you must change the relative paths in index.html.  To publish to git pages, the app was kept as a static page.
